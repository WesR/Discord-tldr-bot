# Discord-tldr-bot
A simple Discord tl;dr bot
This is my __first__ serious python program, so please excuses the weird formatting that I might make.
__NOTE: This is structured horribly, please excuse that. If I ever decide to work on my own shorting algo, it will be rewritten__
# Useage
Currently it only responds to a message starting with the link. This will be improved (and sanitized!)

To add the bot to your server use this link: [retracted for security]
